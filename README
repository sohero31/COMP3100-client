This the repository of code and issues for Stage 1 of the client side ds-sim work for COMP3100.

From the ds-sim user guide provided we obtain a conceptual structure for the program:

  Initialise system state variables by reading
    Simulation configuration file in the server-side simulator
    System information in the client-side simulator
  Initialise Clock (usually starts at simulation time zero)

  While (there is a job to schedule) do
    Get a job to schedule
    Set a clock to next event time (based on the submission time of the job in our case)
    Schedule the job
    Update statistics
  End while

  Generate statistical report


To run the program, clone the repository and then change into the pre-compiled directory.
From there run the server with the desired XML file, i.e. ./ds-server -c ds-sample.xml -v all 
(N.B. [-v all] is not required to run the program but outputs onto the terminal the details of the program run)
Next, run the client side with the command: javac Client.java to compile the file
Finally run: java Client
