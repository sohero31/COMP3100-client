This the repository of code and issues for Stage 1 of the client side ds-sim work for COMP3100.

From the ds-sim user guide provided we obtain a potential structure for the program:

  Initialise system state variables by reading
    Simulation configuration file in the server-side simulator
    System information in the client-side simulator
  Initialise Clock (usually starts at simulation time zero)

  While (there is a job to schedule) do
    Get a job to schedule
    Set a clock to next event time (based on the submission time of the job in our case)
    Schedule the job
    Update statistics
  End while

  Generate statistical report
